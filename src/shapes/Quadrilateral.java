//    More Shapes
//
//    Remove the code from the body of your Rectangle and Square classes.
//
//        Inside of the shapes directory, create a Measurable interface with the following methods:
//
//
//        double getPerimeter();
//        double getArea();
//        Create an abstract Shape class inside of the shapes directory.
//
//        Inside of shapes, create an abstract Quadrilateral class that extends Shape and implements Measurable. This class should have:
//
//protected properties for length and width.
//        a constructor that accepts two numbers for the length and width and sets those properties.
//        methods for getting the length and width.
//abstract methods for setting the length and width.
//        Change your existing Rectangle class to inherit from Quadrilateral and implement Measurable.
//
//        IntelliJ can automatically create the skeleton of all the methods that need to be implemented.
//
//        Change your existing Square class to extend Quadrilateral.
//
//        Because the length of all sides of a square are the same, the methods for setting the length and the width should set both protected properties.
//
//        Modify your ShapesTest class, use it to:
//
//        declare a variable of the type Measurable named myShape.
//        Test your code by creating instances of both Square and Rectangle and assigning them to myShape so you can display the shape's area and perimeter.
//
//        Answer the following questions:
//
//        Why does the code fail to compile if you leave off the getPerimeter method in Rectangle?
//
//        What happens if you try to call the getLength or getWidth methods of the myShape variable? Why?
