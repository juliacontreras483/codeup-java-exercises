//#### Mini-Exercise 2 (Abstract Classes)
//        - Create an abstract class called Appliance with the following properties:
//        - package-private brand;
//        - package-private color;
//        - an empty constructor and a constructor that sets the properties.
//        - getters and setters for properties.
//        - an abstract method named makeSound() - when implemented, prints the sound the appliance makes
//        - an abstract method named doWork()- when implemented, prints what the appliance does
//        - Create a concrete class of Refrigerator that extends Appliance. Implement all abstract methods.
//        - Create a concrete class of Blender that extends Appliance. Implement all abstract methods.
//        - Come up with your own concrete class to extend Appliance and implement abstract methods.
